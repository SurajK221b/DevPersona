      <p class="about-paragraph">
        My expertise lies in <span class="about-highlight">Machine Learning</span>, <span class="about-highlight">Deep
          Learning</span>, <span class="about-highlight">Natural Language Processing</span>, and <span
          class="about-highlight">Generative AI</span>. I've architected and deployed production-grade ML pipelines,
        built predictive models, and integrated LLMs into enterprise applications using <span
          class="about-highlight">Azure ML</span>, <span class="about-highlight">Google Cloud AI</span>, and modern
        MLOps practices.

      <p class="about-paragraph">
        At leading tech companies like <span class="about-highlight">Globant</span> and <span
          class="about-highlight">CitiusTech Healthcare</span>, I've developed intelligent solutions that process
        millions of data points, implement real-time inference systems, and deploy scalable AI models using <span
          class="about-highlight">Docker</span>, <span class="about-highlight">Kubernetes</span>, and cloud-native
        architectures.

        My technical arsenal includes <span class="about-highlight">Python</span>, <span
          class="about-highlight">TensorFlow</span>, <span class="about-highlight">PyTorch</span>, <span
          class="about-highlight">Scikit-learn</span>, <span class="about-highlight">Transformers</span>, and <span
          class="about-highlight">MLflow</span>. I specialize in end-to-end ML workflows—from data ingestion and feature
        engineering to model deployment and monitoring in production environments.
